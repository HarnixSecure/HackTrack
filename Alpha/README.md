Hello HarnixSecurity.

Here will be a global description of alpha group project.

We were asking to perfom a bit of log analysis.

So, after some debates, my colleagues and I, divided that work under 3 distincts stages :
	A - User local connection/deconnection and remote one (SSH) detection
	B - User creation or deletion detection
	C - Sensitive file modification detection

Three files will be pushed by the way :
	- stage1.py which implements A (by alpha one)
	- stage2.py which implements B (by alpha two)
	- stage3.py which implements C (by alpha three)

We've learnt a lot of things especially about logging and new python tools.
